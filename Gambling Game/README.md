This project is a fun game containing 3 different minigames to gamble your money in. These minigames include:

1. Dice Roll
    After you choose how much money you want to bet, a dice will be rolled. You then must guess what number the dice landed on (1-6). If you guess the correct number, then you gain twice as much money as you bet. If your guess is one away, then you gain the amount of money you bet back. If your guess is 2 or more away, then you lose the amount of money you bet.

2. Coin Flip
    After you choose how much money you want to bet, a coin will be flipped. You then must guess what side the coin landed on (Heads or Tails). IF you guess the correct side, you gain twice as much money as the amount you bet. If you guess the incorrect side, you lose the amount of money you bet.

3. Guess and Gain
    After you choose how much money you want to bet, a number will be selected at random from 1-10. The goal is for you to guess any number other than the one that was selected. If you guess a "safe" number, you gain 10% of your bet and may choose to keep guessing numbers or not. If you choose yes, you will keep guessing numbers. If no, then you gain the amount of money you have made so far and may choose to play again or not. If you guess the selected number, your game is over and you lose the amount you bet as well as all the money you have made so far.

You start with $100, and may play any game as much as you want. If you run out of money, you lose. Your goal is to get as much money as possible. Have fun!
